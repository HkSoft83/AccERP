So, the error:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Uncaught ReferenceError: products is not defined
was likely caused by one of the following:

✅ Root Cause:
You have a return statement inside handleSubmit but didn’t close the function properly, so everything after that point is outside the component, including this part:

jsx
Copy
Edit
return (
  <div className="p-4">
    ...
  </div>
);
That means your actual JSX render part is not inside the AddSalesOrder function, which causes weird runtime errors — like products is not defined, even though it clearly is.

🔧 How to Fix
Move this render part (return (...)) back inside the AddSalesOrder function.

✂️ Wrong (your current code):
jsx
Copy
Edit
const handleSubmit = () => {
  ...
  onCancel(); // Close the modal

return (
  <div className="p-4">  ← ❌ This is wrongly placed outside
You forgot a closing } after handleSubmit.

✅ Corrected version:
jsx
Copy
Edit
const handleSubmit = () => {
  ...
  onCancel(); // Close the modal
}; // ✅ CLOSE handleSubmit properly

return (
  <div className="p-4">  // ✅ This is now inside AddSalesOrder
    ...
  </div>
);
✅ Final Fix Summary:
Add a } before your final return (...) to properly close handleSubmit.

Ensure return (...) is inside the AddSalesOrder component.
